## Project Summary:

Our project is a dynamic and interactive simulation of Conway’s Game of Life, an iconic example of cellular automata. This web application will allow users to interact with a grid of cells that evolve based on mathematical rules. The goal is to combine front-end interactivity with back-end functionality using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The application will also include user authentication, session tracking, and pattern loading.

## Key Features:

- **Gameplay Features**: Apply Conway’s rules to transition from one generation to the next. Buttons to: Start Game, Reset Game, and Speeding Cell.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup using PHP & MySQL. Sessions to persist the login state.

## Functionalities:

- **Responsive Grid**: Created using HTML table elements and styled with CSS Grid or Flexbox.
- **Cell Interaction**: Click to toggle between alive (e.g., pink) and dead (e.g., gray) states.
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions to visually represent changes per generation.
